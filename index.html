      <p>I&#8217m a new Developer with a crash-course background in computers and programming.  I recently changed careers, and have spent the last several months learning coding from the ground up at the Portland Code School.  Prior to that, I was a major crimes detective for 6 years.  Prior to my police experience, I was an Army Officer for 4 years, and served two combat tours: one in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and one in Iraq.</p>

      <p>I&#8217m looking for employment in a shop using fast-paced agile development, a comprehensive approach to problem-solving, and where I can expect new and unusual challenges on a regular basis.  I look forward to meeting and interacting with clients, assessing their needs, and working with a trusted team to build and implement the right solution.</p>

      <p>From my military and police careers, I have learned how to solve complex problems in a fast-paced and shifting environment; I have learned how to make the most of team structures so that every member contributes to the solution; and I have learned to pay attention to how the smallest details affect the resolution of even the largest problems.  I look forward to bringing these skills to your office.</p>
